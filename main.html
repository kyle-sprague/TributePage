                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                <p>Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809 in a small log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky. He was always interested in reading and learning which eventually led him to practice law 
                    in Illinois.

                <h3>Start in Politics</h3>
                <p>Lincoln's first attempt in politics was for the Illinois General Assembly a race which he placed eighth out of the thirteen candidates that ran. Only the top four were elected so after this loss
                    Lincoln took a break from  politics to join the Illinois Millitia where he became a popular figure for the speeches he would give. This helped him in his second political campaign in which he 
                    won a seat in the Illinois House of Representatives against a powerful opponent. He would serve four consequtive terms here.

                <h3>Becoming the President of the United States</h3>
                <p>In 1847, Lincoln was eleceted to the US House of Representatives representing Illinois. It was from here he rose through the ranks of the new Republican party and found himself a main candidate 
                    for the 1860 Presidential Election which he would end up winning. 
                </p>

                <h3>Civil War and Emancipation</h3>
                <p>Lincoln's election displeased many southern states as he was very outspoken against slavery. This caused many southern states to secede and form the Confederate States of America. This was the beginning
                    of the American Civil War. Lincoln would not only lead the Union to victory by making the country whole again, he would also sucessfully ban slavery in the United States freeing millions. This is where he earned
                    the nickname "The Great Emancipator."
                </p>

                <h3>Death</h3>
                <p>In 1865 Lincoln was assassinated while attending a play just five days after the Conferacy formally surrendered. He is remembered as one of the greatest presidents in American history for his work to not only preserve
                    the nation but to also bring an end to the evil that was slavery in America.
